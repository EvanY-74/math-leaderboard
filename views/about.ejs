        <h2>What is this?</h2>
        <p>The Math League is a friendly competition testing your math skills. You can attempt problems of various difficulties and gain points.</p>
        <h2>How it works</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Select a problem</li>
            <li>Solve the problem</li>
            <li>Submit answer (linking proof)</li>
            <li>Wait for approval</li>
            <li>Gain points and compete on the leaderboard!</li>
        </ol>
        <!-- <p>Once you have selected a problem and have a possible answer, you can submit it. Then verifiers of that problem will check its validity. Once this is done, points will be added to your total. You can see this total on the leaderboard compared to others.</p> -->
